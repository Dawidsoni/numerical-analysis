# Operating systems

## Description

My solutions to numerical analysis tasks:
 - calculating Pi number using several iterative methods and comparing them
 - dual bases and their application in least-square approximation problem
 - matrix inverse using LU decomposition and QR decomposition (Gram-Schmidt, Householder transformations, Givens rotations)
